## YM2610 ADPCM-B Codec

This is a mirror of the code found [here](http://www.smspower.org/forums/11965-VGMLoggingWithOtherEmulators?start=200#66597) via the excellent [NeoGeo Development Wiki](https://wiki.neogeodev.org/index.php?title=Development_tools). No ownership claimed by me whatsoever, obviously. I just put this up here as a reference to myself so that I don't lose it.

Very lightly modified so that it compiles on macOS, with some warnings fixed. Not tested on a NeoGeo system yet, but encoding and decoding seems to work.

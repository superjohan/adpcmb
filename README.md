## YM2610 ADPCM-B Codec

I (Johan) did not write this; I found this [here](http://www.smspower.org/forums/11965-VGMLoggingWithOtherEmulators?start=200#66597) via the excellent [NeoGeo Development Wiki](https://wiki.neogeodev.org/index.php?title=Development_tools). Therefore I obviously claim no ownership whatsoever.

Very lightly modified so that it compiles on macOS. No idea if it actually works, I haven't gotten that far yet. I just put this up here as a reference to myself so that I don't lose it.
